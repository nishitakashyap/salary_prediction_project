A machine learning project to predict employee salaries using linear regression.
# Salary Prediction Project

Project Objective:  
Predict employee salaries using a Multiple Linear Regression model trained on a dataset with features like CGPA, Projects, and Skills

Project Overview:
As part of my learning journey in Machine Learning (following Andrew Ng’s ML course on Coursera), I built this project to apply my knowledge of linear regression in a real-world context.

This project covers:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Model Building: Training a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
3. Model Evaluation: Calculating R² score and visualizing predictions vs. actual salaries.
4. Visual Analysis: Scatter plots, residual plots, and more.

Dataset:
The dataset contains the following columns:
- 'CGPA' — Cumulative Grade Point Average
- 'Projects' — Number of completed projects
- 'Skills' — Self-reported skill level 
- 'Salary' — The salary to be predicted

Technologies Used
1. Python (Jupyter Notebook)
2. Pandas (for data manipulation)
3. Matplotlib for visualization
4. Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation

Results:
- Achieved an R² score of 0.59, indicating the model explained 59% of the variance in salary based on the provided features.
- Visualized the model performance using:
- Scatter plot with a diagonal line (perfect predictions)

Key Learnings:
 - Understanding the importance of data preprocessing and cleaning.
 - Learning how to interpret model evaluation metrics (like R² score).
 - Visualizing model predictions

How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook file.
3. Install dependencies (e.g., 'pip install -r requirements.txt').
4. Run all cells to see results.
